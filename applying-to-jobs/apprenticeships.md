An apprenticeship is a 6 to 12 month (or longer!) paid training program aimed at developing mastery in specialized, high demand skills. Whether companies today utilize this age old concept to address learning and development in onboarding new employees, internal career progression by establishing clear paths for lateral and vertical promotions, critical hiring gaps for people from non-traditional education backgrounds, or expanding their commitment to inclusive company values: it all comes back to apprenticeship.
