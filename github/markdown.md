Don't underestimate Markdown. As long as there is documentation on Engineering teams, Markdown will be required! For this lesson, instead of reading an article, we will be working on a lab.

Assignment: Create your resume in a [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) file.

Though this lab may seem tedious, it will come in handy. On one hand, you'll get a ton of practice. On the other, you'll be ready to apply to [Microsoft's Apprenticeship Program](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/career-guide/blob/master/apprenticeships.md). Win/win situation!
