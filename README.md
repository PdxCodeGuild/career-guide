## <a name="applying"></a>Applying to Opportunties

> "75 percent of job applications are rejected before they are seen by human eyes." - [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2014/03/18/how-to-get-your-resume-read-by-an-employer/#7f7506136865)

Before applying to jobs, you should make sure your resume is a good match for the job description. Otherwise, your application will never make it pass the Applicant Tracking System (ATS). Use [Jobscan](applying-to-jobs/jobscan.md) to analyze your chances before applying. Jobscan will give you feedback as to what keywords your resume is missing.

## <a name="organize"></a>Staying Organized
Applying to jobs and keeping track of everything can be extremely overwhelming. Use the following resources to keep track of things like:

- applied to job
- referral?
- location of job
- tech stack
- remote flexibility
- initial phone screen date
- thank you note
- follow up
- technical phone screen date
- thank you note
- follow up
- onsite interview date
- follow up
- offer amount
- benefits
- negotiation

Keep track of all of the above with tools like Google Sheets ([example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v4NXFGfQ5p-OH_WLgXusKAoLg8kSDi90H6ylJyBlYaE/edit?usp=sharing)) and [Trello](http://trello.com/)!
