>Networking is a vital part in the job search. 3/5 of my previous jobs were through referrals. 1/5 was due to networking. I literally met Sheri at a housewarming party and asked if she was hiring :) Networking can sound intimidating so make sure to find events that you'll enjoy. That may include a networking happy hour, panels, or company tours. I was referred to my first job out of bootcamp by someone I met at a drone meet up! - [Lisa](http://linkedin.com/in/thecraftycoder)
