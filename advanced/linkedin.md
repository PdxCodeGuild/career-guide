# Updating LinkedIn
[Back to Advanced JS Section](README.md)

The goal of updating your resume is so that you'll show up in recruiter searches. Read the sections below for tips on how to do so.

## Header Section

### Title
Update your title to match the roles you're applying for. For example, I would update mine to: _Front End Developer (React/Node) | Instructor at PDX Code Guild_

## About
The about section should consist of a
- summary
- a list of technologies
- contact info
  - email
  - github
  - portfolios
  - resume
    - I link to a PDF in my Google drive because the size of your resume is reduced after uploading it as a media; making it hard to read

## Featured
Here, I would upload screenshots of your projects. Link the image to where your project/code is hosted (Github, Codenpen.io, CodeSandBox, Heroku, etc.)

## Experience
You need something to bridge the gap between your previous experience to your new career. Volunteer to work on an open source project or start your own freelancing service.
