# Interview Script

Use the guidelines below to nagivate the interview process. After the interviewer states the question...

1. Re-read the problem out loud and literally write everything down on the board. This way you never lose track of what your method is doing.
    - Ex: "Given X return Y". This also gives the interviewer a chance to correct any misunderstandings from the beginning.
    - Be specific, you want to explicitly state the data structure and object type of the given and return. Ex: "Given an array of integers, return an array of integers".
2. Ask questions.
    - For example:
        - “Are the integers whole integers or decimals?”
        - “Are they positive or negative?”
        - “Are they already sorted?”
        - “Are there duplicates or are they all unique?” 
3. Third, (remember you still haven't coded or pseudo coded anything yet) discuss Big O notation of your brute force solution, the next best, and the optimal if you already know and/or work your way into it.
    - Discuss data structures you want to use, pros and cons of different implementations mostly in terms of time and space complexity, and ask if they want you to implement the brute force. Most of the time they will say no and you can move on with the next best or optimal solution.
4. Pseudo code for no more than 1 minute.
    - Up until this moment should only take max 5 minutes, you want to get writing on the board ASAP. 
    - Pseudo what you said out loud during #3. For example:
        - "#sort array"
        - "#traverse and find max"
        - "#binary search for value"
    - This will help with the “deer in headlights” state. You can just read your comments and know what to solve next.
5. Go through test cases, especially edge cases. For example:
    - What if the given is null? Empty? Huge data structure? All duplicates? positive and negative? just one element?
    - Generally try to get through at least one success case and multiple failure cases.
6. Re-check time and space complexity and confirm it's still the same or tell the interviewer that you changed your mind and it should actually be something else.

During this process the interviewer should ideally have said nothing at all! or maybe some hints or pointing you in the right direction. At the end say "I feel pretty confident in my solution but let me think for a minute to see if I can make it more optimal". And try to leave time to ask them questions!
