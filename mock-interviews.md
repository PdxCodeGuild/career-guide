# Mock Interviews

Mock Interviews will be held by appointment only. Resume and LinkedIn reviews must be complete prior to the appointment.

To schedule an appointment, please book via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/lisa-pdx).

## Remote
Remote mock interviews will be held via Google Meetings. Once an appointment is booked on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/lisa-pdx), the Google Meeting link is automatically created and can be accessed through the calendar invite. On the day of your meeting, please log in 10 minutes early to check your video and audio settings. First time using Google Meeting? Read this artcile on [how to join a Google Metting](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9303069?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

Once logged in, I will send you a coding challenge in the [chat feature](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9308979?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) of Google Meetings. When you are ready to start the challenge, you will [share your screen](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9308856?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) and work in your preferred editor and your preferred programming language.

Here is a suggested working format:

```python
'''
Question: For Given a sequence of words, print all anagrams together.

Goal: Print all anagrams together

Input: a list of strings
Ex: str_list = ["eat", "bat", "ate", "tea", "cat", "bat", "tab" ]
Output: a dictionary where the key is the first word and the value is a list of its anagrams.

Edgecases to test for:
- Are the strings all lowercase?
- Are there punctuation? Whitespaces?

Pseudocode:
- this is where you pseudocode

Code:
- write your code here

```
