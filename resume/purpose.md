# The Purpose of a Resume

[Back to Main Page](/README.md)

The purpose of a resume is to provide a summary of your skills, abilities and accomplishments. It is a quick advertisement of who you are. 
A "snapshot" of you with the intent of capturing and emphasizing interests but most importantly, to secure you a job interview.

Your resume is usually the first impression the employer gets from you. They review your resume to see:

- where you studied and what you studied
- prior work experience
- industry specific skills/qualifications etc..
- and ultimately, can you do the job they are looking to fill
