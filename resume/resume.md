## My Big Fat Resume

Do you have multiple versions of your resume scattered throughout your computer? Do you find yourself frantically looking for the right version to send to recruiter #476 ASAP? This use to be me. I've developed a way to organize all my info so that when I find a job I like, it's easy for me to apply quickly. Introducing... My Big Fat Resume!

I have a 5 page [Google Doc](http://docs.google.com/) that acts like a master resume. This document is a living document that I keep updated and reference when applying to jobs. I don't use the same resume for each job that I apply to. I take my time with each opportunity and tailor my resume to it. For example, I often apply to Full Stack Developer and Product Manager positions. You might want to apply to Back End Developer or Database Developer positions. Either way, one resume cannot satisfy both job listings properly. Follow the steps below to start your Big Fat Resume,

Gather relevant information in a master document. I like using [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/) because it auto-saves in the cloud!

  - Name
  - Job Title: should be the position you're applying for
  - Area: Greater Portland
    - Do not put your personal address
  - Contact info
    - phone number
    - email
  - Social Media Links
    - LinkedIn
    - GitHub
    - Personal Portfolio
      - more common for front end positions
      - If you don't want to make a website, you can use an online editor like [Codepen.io](codepen.io)
  - skills
    - Efficient
    - Exposure
  - job history
    - job Title
    - company
    - duration (MM/YY)
    - summary of responsibilities
      - emphasize on being a quick learner, having leadership roles, cross-functional, documentation
  - projects
    - Projects are a great place to highlight your most proud accomplishments at a previous company
    - role
    - company
    - responsibilities

    - This section is not required but sometimes, you need a filler :D

## Formatting
You're more than welcome to try formatting your resume yourself. However, for those who lack the skills, I highly recommend [Creddle](creddle.io). After inputting all your info, you can choose a theme or format. Creddle will do all the work! There are even options to customize the look.

For engineers from non-traditional backgrounds and new grads, because you don't have relevant work experience, you should emphasize your projects. In the project section, you can highlight transferable skills.
