This is Day 6/7 of our 1-week coding interview email course.

The best practice for coding interviews is other coding interviews.

So if you're serious about getting a new job, don't put all your eggs in one basket. You should be trying to interview with as many companies as you can.

Not only does this give you more practice (you'll feel yourself getting better with each interview), but also:
It increases your odds of getting multiple offers, which makes it way easier to ask for another 10, 20, 30+ thousand dollars on your salary when it comes time to negotiate those offers (I'll share more about negotiation tomorrow).
You might end up falling in love with a company that started off on your "just for more interview practice" list. Seriously—it's happened to me!

So here're our tips for getting more interviews:

Apply to hundreds of companies in 60 seconds with Underdog.io. They work with high-growth startups like Asana, Squarespace, and a bunch of others in New York and San Francisco. And their hands-off approach means you get to connect directly with founders and hiring managers.​

Schedule a free Triplebyte interview. It's a low-stress chat with an engineer over Google Hangouts, and they'll tell you your strengths and weaknesses so you know exactly what to study next. And if it goes well: Apple, Dropbox, Mixpanel, Instacart, and hundreds of other companies let you skip straight to their final interview if Triplebyte recommends you.

Flip through some smaller startups on Angel.co. This is a great way to really cast a wide net. Expressing interest in a company is very easy and low-stakes...just press a button. If they're interested in chatting more, you can connect (it's kinda like Tinder for recruiting). Oh, and part of their thing is that salary and equity are transparent right from the get-go, so you won't waste your time with companies that're only going to lowball you (been there!).

Sign up for an account on Hired.com. They're a bit selective about who they work with, but if you get in they take great care of you. They give you a "talent advocate" who...advocates for you and works on getting you the best offers from the best companies.

For those companies that you really have your eye on, that you're planning to just apply to directly...my advice is to try to get a referral from someone inside the company. Companies weigh referred applicants more heavily. Search your LinkedIn and your Facebook to see if you have a friend who can refer you. Even if it's someone you don't know that well...they might still be happy to refer you, since most companies offer them a fat cash bonus for candidates they refer who get hired :)
