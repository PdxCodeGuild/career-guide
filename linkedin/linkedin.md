# LinkedIn

- [Back to Main Page](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/career-guide)

LinkedIn is the the go-to social media platform for connecting with and building your professional network.

## Vanity URL

When creating a LinkedIn for the first time, you might notice that your profile URL is a randomized series of characters following your name. For example: _https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-nguyen-245b5b42_.

This is way to long to include on a resume. A shortened version of this would work better. Some people will change their vanity URL to something resembling their name (i.e. lnguyen or lisan). I wanted to stand out and start a brand so I chose **thecraftycoder** as my online persona. I'm sure you'll agree, **thecraftycoder** looks way better on a resume than **lisa-nguyen-245b5b42**.

If you would like to do the same, follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/career-guide/blob/master/linkedin/vanity_url.md)!

## Info Header

Your info head will be the first thing people see so you want to make a good first impression.

- a professional headshot
  - if you need a headshot, please email our office admin to schedule one: admin@pdxcodeguild.com
- a background image relevant to your profession or hobby
- a title
  - job searchers: this should be the title of roles you're applying to so you'll show up in relevant search results

## About
- an invigorating summary
  - if you are willing to move, I would add that note here
- summary of skills
- contact info

## Media
- This is a good place to attach your resume because it will show up in the **About** section. Please see screenshot above.
- I recommend using the following format when naming your resume file: FirstnameLastname-resume_MMMYYYY.pdf
