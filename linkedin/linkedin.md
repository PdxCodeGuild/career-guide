## Vanity URL

When creating a LinkedIn for the first time, you might notice that your profile URL is a randomized series of characters following your name. For example: _https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-nguyen-245b5b42_.

This is way to long to include on a resume. A shortened version of this would work better. Some people will change their vanity URL to something resembling their name (i.e. lnguyen or lisan). I wanted to stand out and start a brand so I chose **thecraftycoder** as my online persona. I'm sure you'll agree, **thecraftycoder** looks way better on a resume than **lisa-nguyen-245b5b42**.

If you would like to do the same, follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/career-guide/blob/master/linkedin/vanity_url.md).!
