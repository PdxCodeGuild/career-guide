# LinkedIn

- [Back to Main Page](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/career-guide)

LinkedIn is the the go-to social media platform for connecting with and building your professional network. Make sure your profile is 100% complete before linking your profile on your resume or in email signatures.

## Info Header

Your info head will be the first thing people see so you want to make a good first impression.

- a professional headshot
  - if you need a headshot, please email our office admin to schedule one: admin@pdxcodeguild.com
- a background image relevant to your profession or hobby
- a title
  - Use highly searched keywords and informative headlines
  - suggestion: this could be the title of roles you're applying to so you'll show up in relevant search results
- shoot for 500 connections

## Media
- This is a good place to attach your resume because it will show up in the **About** section. Please see screenshot above.
- I recommend using the following format when naming your resume file: FirstnameLastname-resume_MMMYYYY.pdf
- If you'd like to kick it up a notch: FirstnameLastname-PositionResume_MMMYYYY.pdf (ex: LisaNguyen-FullStackDevResume_Jul2019.pdf)
- Recruiters see hundreds of resumes a week. Make yours easy to find!
- Attach Portfolio items in your Summary and Experience Sections.
