# Info Header

[Back to Main Page](/README.md)

Your info head will be the first thing people see so you want to make a good first impression.

- a professional headshot
  - if you need a headshot, please email our office admin to schedule one: admin@pdxcodeguild.com
- a background image relevant to your profession or hobby
- a title
  - Use highly searched keywords and informative headlines
  - suggestion: this could be the title of roles you're applying to so you'll show up in relevant search results
- shoot for 500 connections
