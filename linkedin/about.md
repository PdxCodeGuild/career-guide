# About

[Back to Main Page](/README.md)

The about section is a chance for you to share your story. It should contain:

- an invigorating summary of your career thus far
  - if you are willing to move, I would add that note here
- how you got into tech
- a summary of skills
- contact info
- google drive link to your resume
  - I find that your resume is in a weird format when uploading through LinkedIn media
  - if you go to my [profile page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thecraftycoder/), you'll see what I mean

 ## Examples
 
 *From saving lives to saving code, it's always about the client. After 8 years as a paramedic, I decided to pursue my high school dream of becoming a web developer. I graduated from PDX Code Guild's 14-week Full Stack Web Development course and am looking for a company that offers mentorship. As a mentor myself to new EMTs, I know how valuable mentorship is to one's career growth. When I'm not learning a new coding language, framework, or responding to emergencies, I enjoy spending time with my wife and kids.*
 
 *I am a dedicated, enthusiastic developer who as a child, took apart hardware to see how everything worked "under the hood". 20 years later, that sense of curiosity drives me to understand how bits of code work together to create a powerful tool that benefits every day users.*
