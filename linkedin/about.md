# About

[Back to Main Page](/README.md)

The about section is a chance for you to share your story. It should contain:

- an invigorating summary of your career thus far
  - if you are willing to move, I would add that note here
- how you got into tech
- a summary of skills
- contact info
- google drive link to your resume. I find that your resume is in a weird format when uploading through LinkedIn media
