# In-Place Algorithm

An in-place function modifies data structures or objects outside of its own stack frame â†´ (i.e.: stored on the process heap or in the stack frame of a calling function). Because of this, the changes made by the function remain after the call completes.

> In-place algorithms are sometimes called **destructive**, since the original input is "destroyed" (or modified) during the function call.

> **Careful: "In-place" does not mean "without creating any additional variables!"** Rather, it means "without creating a new copy of the input." In _general_, an in-place function will only create additional variables that are O(1) space.

An **out-of-place** function doesn't make any changes that are visible to other functions. Usually, those functions copy any data structures or objects before manipulating and changing them.

In many languages, **primitive** values (integers, floating point numbers, or characters) are copied when passed as arguments, and more complex **data structures** (lists, heaps, or hash tables) are passed by reference. This is what Python does.

Here are two functions that do the same operation on a list, except one is in-place and the other is out-of-place:

```Python 2.7
def square_list_in_place(int_list):
    for index, element in enumerate(int_list):
        int_list[index] *= element

    # NOTE: no need to return anything - we modified
    # int_list in place


def square_list_out_of_place(int_list):
    # We allocate a new list with the length of the input list
    squared_list = [None] * len(int_list)

    for index, element in enumerate(int_list):
        squared_list[index] = element ** 2

    return squared_list
```
**Working in-place is a good way to save time and space.** An in-place algorithm avoids the cost of initializing or copying data structures, and it usually has an O(1) space cost.

**But be careful: an in-place algorithm can cause side effects.** Your input is "destroyed" or "altered", which can effect code _outside_ of your function. For example:

```Python
original_list = [2, 3, 4, 5]
square_list_in_place(original_list)

print(f"original list: {original_list}")
#prints: original list: [4, 9, 16, 25], confusingly!
```

**Generally**, out-of-place algorithms are considered safer because they avoid side effects. You should only use an in-place algorithm if you're space constrained or you're _positive_ you don't need the original input anymore, even for debugging.
